# Ooooby Recipe Exercise
A simple application that lets a user search for recipes by title. It pulls data from some JSON files and makes this available through an MVC/Razor front end.

## Purpose
We want to assess you on your ability to code rather than your ability to deal with interview surprises.
By supplying you with the exercise in advance, we hope to give you the opportunity to show us your best work.

## Instructions
- Clone this repository and ensure you can build and run it locally in your IDE of choice (we use Rider).
- Familiarise yourself with the codebase, and prepare some feedback about what you'd change if you were to work on this project full-time.
- Be prepared to share your screen and make changes to the application based on new product requirements.

You are welcome but not expected to make any changes you'd like to the application ahead of time to make it work better for you in the interview.
